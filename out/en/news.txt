7:T1590,Despite that cybersecurity, for a long time, has been crucial for both business survival and national security, the acquisition of a classified security system is still a complex process. <b>Mollitiam</b> simplifies this process by being Sweden’s first comprehensive provider of classified security solutions.<br/><br/>
In just one year, we have established ourselves as a <i>pioneer</i> in <b>digital supremacy</b>, which to us means ensuring that <i>digital information does not fall into the wrong hands.</i> Keep reading to learn about the motivation behind creating Mollitiam and how we simplify cybersecurity.<br/><br/>

<h3>A Comprehensive IT-Solution</h3> Previously, there was no supplier that could offer a complete solution from start to finish.<br/><br/>
Due to the current complexity in acquiring information security management, organizations often attempt to build and maintain their own classified networks. However, since the surrounding world has rapidly changing demands for classified IT systems, it makes it both difficult and costly for organizations to manage their own networks. <b>Mollitiam</b> created a solution – classified systems as a service.<br/><br/>

<i>More and more people are realizing that it is no longer cost-effective to build their own classified systems themselves. By engaging with us, organizations receive a comprehensive solution, where we take full responsibility for designing, maintaining, and auditing classified systems and infrastructures for security-sensitive operations,</i> <b>Patrik Nilsson</b>, CEO of Mollitiam, explains.<br/><br/>

<h3>The Global Situation Makes IT-Structure Even More Relevant</h3> There has been a substantial increase in attempts from foreign powers, trying to disrupt IT functions in Sweden. These attempts pose the greatest threat to organizations' security. <b>Mollitiam</b> works to <b>manage and prevent these threats</b> by offering robust and flexible classified security solutions that are constantly evolving to adapt to new challenges.<br/><br/>
CEO <b>Patrik Nilsson</b>, with a background in developing and implementing effective system solutions in both private and public sectors, understands the challenges that the current IT systems face, as cyberattacks are becoming an increasingly large part of our everyday life.<br/><br/>

<i>Our long experience, working in accordance with Swedish legislation, has resulted in a solution which in a very flexible and efficient manner meets all of the regulations. Therefore, it is user-friendly, despite the underlying technique being very complex.</i><br/><br/>

<h3>Digital Supremacy – A Matter of National Interest</h3> <b>Digital supremacy</b> means having full control of your digital information and ensuring that it does not fall into the wrong hands. For Sweden, as well as many other countries, this is a critical issue.<br/><br/>
<i>For Sweden, it is crucial to protect information from falling into the hands of foreign powers. For businesses and authorities, it is essential to have control of their data and minimize the risk for external exposure,</i> <b>Patrik</b> continues.<br/><br/>

Classified systems are a part of the <b>civil defense</b> and, therefore, also a part of Sweden’s total defense. As <b>Mollitiam</b> continues to grow, the ambition is to build an ecosystem, which will complete our line of different services and strengthen our offerings. Now, people in leading positions have come to realize that it is better to engage the services of a specialized company to protect the most sensitive information.<br/><br/>

<i>Cyberthreats have shifted from being future problems to being more of an everyday reality, and people are becoming more aware of the fact that they can be affected by data breaches. What’s tragic is that it often has gone too far before any change is made. Therefore, we talk to our clients about these threats and we have noticed that they are becoming increasingly interested in discussing how to protect their data,</i> says <b>Patrik</b>.<br/><br/>

<h3>Classified Systems – As a Service</h3> Regardless of what type of IT an organization has, hardware, software, and installation must be integrated, and the organization itself is responsible for all of this. This also means that the organization is responsible when the IT system does not work, and you might have to call vendors when there’s a problem. The path to a secure IT system needs to be simpler and shorter.<br/><br/>
<i>We support our clients throughout the entire process, and we obtain the approvals needed from the regulatory authorities, so that our clients can feel secure. We take full responsibility for IT integration, which simplifies and improves the implementation process significantly.</i><br/><br/>

People who commit breaches of data do not need to follow any protocol or regulations, and they will therefore continuously come up with new ways of stealing information. Affected authorities will, as a result, always be one or two steps behind. Therefore, they need to react and adapt rapidly.<br/><br/>

<i>We need to take this more seriously. These threats will constantly change and evolve, and we need to continuously think about how we can improve classified systems even more, every day. By offering a comprehensive service, <b>Mollitiam</b> fills a previous gap in the market, allowing organizations to focus on their core business, instead of having to manage complex cybersecurity issues,</i> <b>Patrik</b> concludes.<br/><br/>2:[["$","div",null,{"className":"news-page-section-wrapper","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-global","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-section-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-page-content-wrapper","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"NEWS"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"news-grid","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"nyheter-wrapper","children":["$","a","2",{"href":"/en/news/mollitiam-on-the-frontline-for-digital-supremacy","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-content-card","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"backgroundImage":"url(/medium_Group_103_aec4c8ec8a.jpg)"},"className":"nyheter-content-card-top"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-content-card-bottom","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-content-card-text-wrapper","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-date","children":"2023•12•19"}],["$","h3",null,{"children":"Mollitiam – On the Frontline for Digital Supremacy"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"nyheter-paragraph-one","children":"$7"}]]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-las-mer","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-las-mer-content","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":"READ MORE"}],["$","img",null,{"src":"/right-arrow.svg","alt":"Read More"}]]}]}]]}]}]]}]]}]}]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-section-wrapper","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-global","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-section-small","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-content-wrapper","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/logo-white-text.png","alt":"Logo"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"breakline"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-wrapper","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-content-left","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["$","b",null,{"children":"Address"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Mollitiam AB"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Brunkebergsgatan 10"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"111 52, Stockholm"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"copyright","children":["$","p",null,{"children":"Copyright Mollitiam AB 2024"}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-content-middle","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["$","b",null,{"children":"Postal Address"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Mollitiam AB"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Aspövägen 41"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"125 40, Älvsjö"}]]}]]}]]}]}]}]}]}]]

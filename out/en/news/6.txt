Therefore, we are very pleased to welcome Hannes Lindroos as the new CFO of C-Resiliens.

Growing cyber threats pose an increasing problem for nations and organizations. Our customers in security-sensitive businesses are demanding more and more secure and user-friendly solutions, and this not only places a demand on our products and services, but also on us as a company to remain and develop as a long-term and stable partner.

Hannes Lindroos has both long and solid experience in financial planning, management and control. His latest role was as the CFO at PriceRunner, where he has worked with several different financial issues including financial strategic planning, acquisitions, sales of companies and preparation of IPOs.

"Cybersecurity is a new field for me but I have long observed how the cyber threat has increasingly affected citizens, businesses and nations and how cybersecurity has become an increasingly important issue for more and more people. The cyber threat is likely to escalate and good cyber security that safeguards citizens, companies and nations is a prerequisite for the functioning of society", says Hannes and continues "I look forward to learning more about the industry and at the same time using my experience to further develop CR into a long-term successful industry leader and stable partner."

"We are really looking forward to working with Hannes, his extensive knowledge and experience in the field bodes well for the future and makes us even better equipped to help our customers in security-sensitive operations", says Björn Weigel, CEO at C-Resiliens.2:[["$","div",null,{"className":"news-article-section-wrapper","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-global","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"news-article-content-wrapper","children":[["$","img",null,{"className":"news-main-image","src":"/medium_Group_103_aec4c8ec8a.jpg"}],["$","h6",null,{"children":"2023•12•19"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"news-article-text-wrapper","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"MOLLITIAM STRENGTHENS CYBER SECURITY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH NEW COLLABORATION"}],["$","p",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$9"}}]]}]]}]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"more-articles-content-wrapper","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-global","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-section-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"more-articles-section","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"More articles"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"more-articles-wrapper","children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"nyheter-wrapper","children":["$","a","3",{"href":"/en/news/3","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-content-card","children":[["$","div",null,{"style":{"backgroundImage":"url(/medium_Group_105_e8a23ca167.jpg)"},"className":"nyheter-content-card-top"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-content-card-bottom","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-content-card-text-wrapper","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-date","children":"2023•12•07"}],["$","h3",null,{"children":"RAPID BUSINESS GROWTH IN CYBERSECURITY"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"nyheter-paragraph-one","children":"$a"}]]}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-las-mer","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"nyheter-las-mer-content","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":"READ MORE"}],["$","img",null,{"src":"/right-arrow.svg","alt":"Read More"}]]}]}]]}]}]]}]]}]}]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-section-wrapper","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-global","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-large","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"padding-section-small","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-content-wrapper","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/logo-white-text.png","alt":"Logo"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"breakline"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-wrapper","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-content-left","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["$","b",null,{"children":"Address"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Mollitiam AB"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Brunkebergsgatan 10"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"111 52, Stockholm"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"copyright","children":["$","p",null,{"children":"Copyright Mollitiam AB 2024"}]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-content-middle","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":["$","b",null,{"children":"Zipcode"}]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Mollitiam AB"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Aspövägen 41"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"125 40, Älvsjö"}]]}]]}]]}]}]}]}]}]]
